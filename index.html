    <p id="main-bio">
        As a driven and tech-savvy Web Developer, I have always been pulled towards technology. I am currently pursuing an intensive Web Development Coding Certification at the George Washington University. I am gaining experience in the foundations of web development while honing my skills in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, and Node.js. Having an appetite for continuous learning, collaboration, and problem-solving, I plan to create and maintain websites, while also developing iOS & Android apps. Equally passionate about building applications that assist everyday people to make their lives easier. Looking to bring my attention to detail and technical skills to a company to grow and become a valuable asset.
